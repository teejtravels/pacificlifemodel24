This is our UCI MS in Business Analytics Capstone project.
We are analyzing bloomberg market data, which we sourced from UCI's bloomberg terminal. This data had to be cleaned, organized and then uploaded to github to work with our financial model.

We developed a model to analyze the different indicators of different asset classes to classify them and rank them.

We then integrated the financial modeling into streamlit to allow access via a webapp to create a dynamic dashboard using python and not something expensive like tableau or powerbi. 

Project team: Vincent, Casey, TJ, Bangyang, and Veronica.
